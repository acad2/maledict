        <p>
            The <strong>Master Properties Dialog</strong> is used to set global variables
            for use in the user-defined Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN). They are
            as follows:
            <br />

        </p>
        <hr />
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Field</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Block size</td>
                <td>
                    The number of bits going into each round of the SPN cipher.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Num. rounds</td>
                <td>
                    The number of rounds through which the data will iterate during the
                    encryption process. The final round consists only of a Key, and this
                    tool will not allow other components.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S-box size</td>
                <td>
                    The number of bits in each bijective S-box for the cipher. All S-boxes
                    in the SPN will be of equal size, and each will have input size equal
                    to their output size. This value must evenly divide the block size.
