        <h1>Help With Difference Distribution Tables</h1>
        <p>
            A <strong>difference distribution table (DDT)</strong> is a table designed to
			summarize a predictable difference between pairs of input values and output
			values. That is, two inputs XOR'd together would correspond predictably with
			two outputs XOR'd together.
        </p>
		<p>
			For a given S-box, a DDT denotes an input difference which, when applied to a
			given input pair, will result in a certain difference between its outputs.
			The row corresponds to the input difference to the S-box, and the column
			corresponds to the output difference from the S-box.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, given an input difference of 1011, one would pass two applicable
			input values, such as 0101 and 1110. For the row corresponding to 1011, the
			cell in the column for the resultant difference in outputs (the value of the
			outputs bitwise-XOR'd together) will be incremented.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final value in each cell represents the number of times that a particular
			combination of input/output masks produce a certain difference, in total.
			A value of zero means that the difference does not occur at all, while higher
			values indicate that the difference is more likely. There are no negative
			values for a cell in a DDT, unlike in a LAT, as it only counts the total
			occurrences of a given difference.
