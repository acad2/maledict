            A permutation is a <strong>shuffling</strong> of input bits.
            It consists of a one-to-one mapping of bit-positions between input and output,
            in which the set of output bits is equivalent to the set of input bits, except
            with regards to ordering.

            An example of a permutation outside the field of computer science is seen above.
            An <strong>anagram</strong> is the result of permuting letters in one word to form
            another word.
