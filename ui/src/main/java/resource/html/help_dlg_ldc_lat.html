        <h1>Help With Linear Approximation Tables</h1>
        <p>
            A <strong>linear approximation table (LAT)</strong> is a table designed to
			summarize the degree of linearity for different input/output combinations with
			regards to a particular S-box.
        </p>
		<p>
			For a given S-box, an LAT denotes an input and an output mask which, when
			applied to a given input/output pair, will result in an equal value when all
			resultant bits are XOR'd together. The row corresponds to the input mask to
			the S-box, and the column corresponds to the output mask from the S-box.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, given an input <em>mask</em> of 1011 and output mask of 1100, an
			input <em>value</em> of 1101 would be masked to 1011&and;1101=1001, and an
			output value of 1111 would be masked to 1100&and;1111=1100. This is tested via
			1&oplus;0&oplus;0&oplus;1=1&oplus;1&oplus;0&oplus;0. Both sides evaluate to 0,
			so it passes, and the cell in the table at position (B (1011), C (1100)).
		</p>
		<p>
			However, an input of 1111 and output of 1101 would not evaluate to the same
			value, and therefore the value would not increment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final value in each cell represents the number of times that a particular
			combination of input/output masks produce a valid linear approximation, in
			terms of variance from chance. A value of zero means that the approximation
			holds exactly half the time. A positive value means that the approximation
			holds more than half the time, a negative value less than half the time.
