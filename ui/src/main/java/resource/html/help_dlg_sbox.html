        <p>
            An S-box (<strong>substitution box</strong>) is a component to a cryptographic
            cipher where input is <em>substituted</em> with another value upon output.
            An ideal S-box seeks to minimize relationships between input and output that
            could be used to break a cipher. S-boxes are the main component that keeps a
            cipher from having a predictable input-output relationship, which is why both
            linear and differential cryptanalysis attempt to exploit estimations for certain
            relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            In linear cryptanalysis, an attacker seeks to simulate a linear relationship
            between input and output, wherein a line can be drawn through the box from a
            set of input bits to a set of output bits, considering them equivalent. This
            is similar to estimating a permutative relationship, except the difference is
            not one-to-one.
        </p>
        <p>
            In differential cryptanalysis, an attacker seeks to discover some relationship
            between input and output differentials--that is, differences in certain bits
            between two inputs will produce a certain difference between outputs. Unlike
            a linear relationship, exploiting a differential requires a set of chosen
            plaintext values, rather than just known ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            An S-box does not inherently have the same number of bits in its output as it
            does for its input, although it must in order to be <strong>reversible</strong>.
            In order to perform linear or differential cryptanalysis, an S-box must be
            reversible, which is why such S-boxes are the only type supported by this tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            S-boxes are also not necessarily fixed for a given cipher. For example, Twofish
            generates S-boxes based on the key chosen for the cipher. This tool does not
            support any sort of analysis on this variety of cipher.
