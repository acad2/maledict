        <h1>Help With Linear Cryptanalysis</h1>
        <p>
            Linear Cryptanalysis is a method of cryptanalysis in which multiple linear
			approximations of individual S-boxes (see the help page for the Linear
			Approximation Table dialog) are chained together to form a general linear
			approximation for the complete cipher.
        </p>
		<p>
			The S-box approximations' outputs are traced through the remainder of the
			cipher, and any other S-boxes that the bits travel through along the way must
			also be approximated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon completion of the full-cipher approximation, a known plaintext-ciphertext
			pair is analyzed against the approximation. This is done through partial
			decryption of the ciphertext through the last round of S-boxes. By comparing
			the results to the linear approximation, partial values for the last subkey
			can be obtained.
		</p>
		<p>
			A large number of known pairs are decrypted for every potential value of the
			target partial subkey, and the one for which the greatest number of
			decryptions hold for this pattern is assumed to be the key.
